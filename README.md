# Health Concierge Landing Page

* [Health Concierge](https://www.healthconcierge.com.mx)

This project is a landing page for Health Concierge, a startup that offers an integrated system of commonly required health services for guests through a digital platform. The goal of this project was to create a seamless and user-friendly interface to showcase the company’s services and benefits.
As the developer of this project, I built the website using React and SCSS and hosted it on Netlify. I focused on creating a responsive design using CSS to ensure that the website looks great on all devices.
